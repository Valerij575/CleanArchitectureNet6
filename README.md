# CleanArchitectureNet6

	In this project, we will create solution and projects based on the 
clean architecture, and define the project dependencies.
	Also, we will create authentication endpoints and models for register, 
login requests and responses.
	Finally, we will create an autentication service that returns a mock
response, and use the "REST client".
	In addition, we will set up dependency injection for both 
the application and infrastructure layers.
